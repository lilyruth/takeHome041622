# This is a take-home challenge. 

## Conditions specified were:
 - Vanilla JS or JQuery
 - One page web application
 - Receives JSON data and renders to the DOM using jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. 
 - Display each user in a TABLE
 - When a user is selected, all of the posts are displayed that were created by that user. 

 ## The site should be fully mobile responsive. 
 
 ## I am happy with the use of vanilla JS to render the desired elements to the dom, including the use of a table. 

 ## The fonts are also embedded in the project so as to avoid tracking
